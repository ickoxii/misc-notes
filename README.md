# misc-notes

Here lies various things I have learned during my coding career. A majority of
these sources are the result of Google searches or Chat GPT queries.

## helpfulC++

This contains an assortment of algorithms in C++. Some have been taken from my
classes at university, some have not. But all have not been created originally
by me.

## learn-bash-commands

This directory contains information on various bash commands, such as the `ln`
command (used to create symlinks).

## learn-bash-script

Source code and notes taken from: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4>

Contains notes on bash scripting constructs, useful for automation.

## learn-git

Information in README.md gleaned (with consent) from Chat GPT.

## learn-lldb
